"""Settings are never imported from here.

`config.settings.dev` and `config.settings.prod` are the two real modules, and
`config.settings.test` derives from dev. Nothing imports `config.settings`
directly, because a settings module that can be selected by accident is how a
development server ends up addressing production data (BUILD_PLAN P-04).
